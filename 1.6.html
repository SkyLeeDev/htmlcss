                       <h2>1.6 - Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. â€“ How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control</h2> </div>

                       <p>Trello has been of so much use to me, making the management and organisation of my project much easier to control. I can clearly see which tasks i've completed along with tasks in progress and tasks which are yet to be started.</p>
                       
                       <p>Equally important, Github is used for version control and to upload any digital projects such as websites, when using Github with multiple people, everyone can work on the same project with the same code however any adjustments or amendments made to the code will not mess up with whatever you're working although Github will always recognise any new changes to the project and keep it updated as you go along so that you're always seeing the most recent version of your code/project.</p>
