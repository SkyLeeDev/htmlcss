<p>When using a webpage, some people may inccur difficulties depending on things such as style and colour of the webpage. The colours of a webpage can be a problem to users that are colour blind as well as flashing images and lights that can really be a problem to users that may have epilepsy.</p>

<p>Upon creating webpages in future i'd like to consider these problems and research further so that I can cater my webpages with a little more consideration to such users or alternatively create an alternate way of viewing my website as to not be too overwhelming for the senses, the alternative site wouldremove anything that is difficult to be viewed by some users. It would also be a good idea to include a warning for users with epilepsy before they attempt to view potentially dangerous web pages.</p>

<p>Some users may also have poor eyesight and adding the ability to zoom or change font size within the webpage may be an additional feature I could add to my project to solve this issue.</p>
    
<p>Avoiding making the page too busy by overloading it with too many images and text at once or clashing colours is also a good general rule when creating a webpage. Additionally taking into account different browsers and devices that users may use will help make the most out of a website when designing it.</p>
