                   <p>When planning my website I had to think about the structure and the design of the pages, after a quick search on DeviantArt I did find a background that I loved and I used this as the base for my design. The overall design of my website implemented a specific colour scheme and style based on this image aswell.</p>

                <p>Before beginning to code my website, I used trello.com as a base for all my planning and ideas. Within this website I can use it to organise and keep track of my completed tasks aswell as tasks in progress and tasks that need to be done. I found this website particularly useful with the planning of my site as I can constantly keep a live update of what needs to be done and what has been done which makes things easier to prioritise.</p>
