<p>Using stock imagery and other sourced assets during a build is often quicker and more practical whilst developing a website, but it’s important to use the correct assets before anything is published to ensure there are no copyright infringements that could lead to legal action. The best way to ensure there is minimal risk is to maintain an asset table.</p> 

<p>This can be as simple as a few columns stating; what the asset is, where it came from, if permission is required to use it or already obtained, and where it’s used. Large organisations normally have a repository of assets with plugin tools to use when building an application, and this updates the audit log for what has been used and where.</p>
