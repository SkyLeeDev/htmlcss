<p>There are different types of testing, from accessibility, security through to speed and browser compatibility. It’s important to keep up to date with the different standards that control how testing should be performed. Making use of the right tools is vital to ensure the best results.</p>

<p>Google provide a number of testing tools that are used by both small to large application developers, right the way up to large enterprise. Google Page Insights is a great tool, it analyzes the content of a web page digging into the methods used to build and generate the page under review, then generates a report showing what elements need to be improved, as well as the sources of those items so that you can tell if the item being rendered is requiring improvements, or if it’s an external source such as tracking code or other script, if it’s causing you problems.</p>

<p>Google Mobile-Friendly Test is a vital tool for your testing process. More than half (and it’s still an upward trend) of web consumption is on mobile devices, so ensuring your application performs well on mobile is critical.</p>
