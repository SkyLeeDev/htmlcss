            <p>For future reference when using Trello, I would make sure to colour co-ordinate my tasks to make them much easier to distinguish aswelll as just adding all tasks to the to-do lists immediately before starting any of the tasks. I could also use Trello to keep track of any personal goals in regards to my digital projects.</p>

            <p>As far as VSCode goes, I would prefer to have subfolders for different sections of my website as I would find this cleaner and easier to manage my actual website. It was advised for this project not to do so however for future projects I would like to try that as I think it would personally be benefical for me. I found it fairly easy to edit any code necessary for my website via VSCode.</p>
