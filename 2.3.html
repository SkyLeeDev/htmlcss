<p>Overall I am quite pleased with my final project, I enjoyed creating this website much more than I have when attempting to create websites in the past. 
I felt more passionate about this website and found it easier to find a style that I liked in comparison to previous projects.</p>

<p>Personally I dont think there's anything I want to change however there is always room for improvement, I would like to take more time to analyse my website and cater it more around people that may have difficulty viewing my site as it is whether that be due to things such as colour-blindness or simply down to the browser or device they are using to try to use it, my main basis for improvement would be to make sure all users get to experience my website as is intended.</p>
