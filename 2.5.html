<p>Whilst creating my website, I constantly saved changes and put them to test within my webrowser to confirm whether or not I was on the right track of what I wanted to achieve.</p>

<p>The content of my website was based on a work document that I wrote, I checked through all of my content for mistakes aswell as just to amend the structure of the paragraphs if needed.</p>
    
<p>The HTML used for my website was thoroughly checked during and after the creation of my website, to ensure that all links worked as they should whether that be a redirection to an external site like Trello or to another page within my website.</p>
    
<p>Similarly the CSS was also thoroughly checked in order to comply with my original colour schemes rather than each page being completely different, I kept the base design of my website the same so that it was clear that all pages were from the same website and so that users could easily distinguish that.</p>
    
<p>Where needed, I included references to external sites that I had used when researching certain topics such as GDPR as I had some knowledge but needed to do a little further reading in order to properly answer the question.</p>
