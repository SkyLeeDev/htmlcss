    <div class="title"><h2>1.2 - Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully </h2></div>

    <p>Various methods and tools can be used in order to successfully complete digital projects, as an example, when creating a website it is essential to use applications such as VSCode or notepad++ in order to create the functionality of the website via HTML and the design of the website via CSS(external style sheet). Additionally knowledge of HTML and CSS is required and where necessary research into further knowledge of these languages in order to get the full potential from the website.</p>

    <p>Another example is the creation of an internet prompt game using Javascript, assuming this is created in a group project communication will be essential, keeping track of which tasks are completed and in progress and by who via sites such as trello can be very useful in handling the organisation of the project. Again researching online will be relevant if any problems occur or if unsure about how to achieve exactly what is desired from the code.</p>
