<p>I think I would still prefer to complete this particular digital project as an individual as opposed to within a team as I find a great sense of accomplishment and pride in my own creations aswell as just being able to track my own progression and improvements over my projects.</p>

<p>However I would definetly consider completing it as a member of a team if given the right project or circumstances, I think it could be beneficial to work on a website with multiple people if there was a bigger time frame(allowing for extra time to fix any confusion that could occur between members and their seperate codes or decisions for example) Github would be specifically useful if creating a website within a team.</p>
   
<p>Planning a website can be quite difficult especially if you're unsure of where to begin. Next time I attempt to create a website, I will consider designing a flow chart via draw.io or similarly a hand drawn plan that can help put a different perspective onto the website I am trying to create rather than just going straight from an image in my brain to inputting the code, planning in such ways can greatly increase the way you visualise your website and definetly help kick start the whole project.</p>
