<p>The website worked well as an individual project and I believe that if more was required of the website within the same time frame, then working in a team may be more beneficial however overall I feel that the website would be easier for me to complete by myself rather than with others as even with proper planning there can still become mix ups when exchanging codes and working on different pages of the same websites.</p>
