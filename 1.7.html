                   <p>As of recent times, GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) plays a larger impact on the web than it has ever done before in an attempt to protect consumers from unsolicited data attacks. All companies must comply with these rules & regulations or face tough penalties such as a percentage of the companies annual revenue.</p>

                    <p>GDPR currently does not specify how long companies can retain consumer data for, however it states that the data should not be kept for longer than necessary.  Ideally once the consumer can no longer use that data to make a claim, or the business no longer needs it to provide evidence then the data should be deleted.</p>
                    
                    <p>Website cookies can be used to identify an individual, Therefore GDPR state that any website must obtain clear and specific consent from each user to allow the website to continue tracking and obtaining your personal data. This is commonly handled by providing a pop-up when the user first enters to page and providing 'yes' or 'no' options that the user has to agree with for cookies to be provided access.</p>
                    
                    <p>Although GDPR rules & regulations are not easy guidelines to apply, Implementing them will indefinitely slow down your project timescale, however they do ensure the protection of both the consumer and the business. Therefore providing your digital project with the security it needs to progress further the right direction.</p>
