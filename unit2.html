<p>When it came to designing the layout of my website, it all kind of fell in to place once I found the right background image. Originally I was searching for some kind of neon theme but stumbled upon some beautiful japanese style artwork via deviantart.com that incorporated some lovely colours with a neon feel.</p>

<p>Once I had my desired background, I just went through some trial and error in terms of choosing which colours in particular would be the main focus, I decided more towards the dark and green colours from the background and worked around that using white as the base colour for text as I felt it stood out the most on my desired background. To avoid making it look too bulky and harsh, I did change the opacity of the text box along with opacity of some of the text whilst leaving the nav bar more prominent in order to stand out.</p>
    
<p>I chose to have my nav bar at the top of my page and included drop down menu's  within that to seperate the content via preferred unit and outcomes. I found this was the most suitable way to organise the content of my website.</P>

<p>The home page included a small gif, I didn't particularly want a gif originally however I felt there was something missing and didn't want to just drop another image on top of my background image. Since my background image is quite busy, I wanted to keep everything else quite simple in terms of design whilst making it as aesthically pleasing as I could.</p>
