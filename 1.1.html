<p>In this current day it is essential for a business to utilise IT in various ways, more so now than ever. Businesses need IT for both internal and external communication, using various types of software to organise and manage everything from clients to stock and even the finances, including but not limited to the payroll of the employees. Businesses tend to have their own Local Network to connect all users and devices such as printers, and often even Virtual Private Networks within those for added security.</p>

<p>
    It's not only tech companies that will need to use IT for their business, even non-tech companies such as ones in the retail industry will need to use IT in order to fulfill online orders and replenish appropriate stock also just keeping track of when stock is needed to be purchased and getting a website built to allow for online orders. Many companies may also use IT to host and participate in conference calls with other businesses and such.
